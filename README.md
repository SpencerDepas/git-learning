A test repo to help learn git
=============================

I want to learn:

* Repos
* Commits
* Branches
* Remotes
* Other interesting stuff

Here is some code:

    function foo() {
        console.log("hi!");
    }

I'll show you some numbers:

1. First things first.
2. Then this.
3. And perhaps we'll cover this.
